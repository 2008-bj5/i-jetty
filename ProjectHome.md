A port of the popular **[Jetty](http://www.eclipse.org/jetty)** open-source web container to run on the Android mobile device platform.Having a "personal" webserver on your phone opens up a world of possibilities, letting you run your favourite existing webapps in your mobile environment.

Moreover, as webapps developed for i-jetty have access to the Android API, this means that you can bring the contents of your mobile phone to your normal desktop browser.

To demonstrate the possibilities, we've created a ["Console" webapp ](ConsoleWebApplication.md)that interfaces to the data on your mobile device. You don't need any special software to synchronize the mobile data to your desktop computer - the i-jetty console webapp makes your on-phone info like contacts lists, call logs and media instantly available and manageable via your browser. We've packaged the Console webapp as an Android application so it can be conveniently downloaded and updated via the Android Marketplace.

i-jetty can also dynamically download webapps from anywhere on the net. To help get you started, we've also created a "Hello World" webapp that is simpler than the Console webapp. You can either build it from src and install it locally, or you can point i-jetty to the pre-built hello.war on the [download page](http://code.google.com/p/i-jetty/downloads/list).

The apks for i-jetty and the i-jetty Console webapp are both available from the Android Marketplace, and also from the [download page](http://code.google.com/p/i-jetty/downloads/list).
